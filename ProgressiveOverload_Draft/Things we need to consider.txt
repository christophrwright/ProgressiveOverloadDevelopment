What kind of training to focus on (goals):
    General
    beginner
    strength

Factors:
    man
    woman
    body type
    experience
    goals
    time? Available schedule?
    equipment

things to account for in data:
    muscles (group & individual)
    schedule
    current level (weights, reps, sets, schedule)
    goals (if any)
    starting info
    calibrations
    notes

What we need:
    a way to read in added data
    process that data to determine next steps
    issue reccomended training based on goals, current stats, personal profile

Ways beginners are different from experienced folk:
    need a tutorial
    don't know what exercises are
    don't know what they can do
    don't know about muscles, training, gym etiquette
    don't have a schedule or a workout habit
    unrealistic expectations

training should be predetermined; we can't build an accurate algorithmic model with the information we have; we would need to get the aid of a professional to be able to help us with that, and it would mostly be predetermined anyway.

workout routines need to be able to be suggested on the fly; we need to know what exercises fit well with each other.

So, we need a way of categorizing the exercises.
    * what muscles an exercise uses
    * is it being used as a warm up
    * what muscle group the exercise is
    * what other muscles are used to do this exercise
    * how muscle groups pair with each other; how to pair them
    * which muscle groups are more important, need to be worked out more.
    * Which muscle groups have been worked out recently, and when.
    * how the muscle groups are being trained.
    * any special considerations: hurt / missing limb, etc.

Include disclaimer about how, even though it's outside the scope of this app, cardio is also important.

                if(exercise.weeksAtCurrentWeight < 2){
                    reps = reps * 1.25
                }else{
                    nextWeight = listOfWeights[i+2]
                    reps = reps * .5
                }
            }
            else{
                nextWeight = listOfWeights[i]
                reps = reps * 1.5
            }
    }
